<h2><strong>We’ve spent 59 years building and shaping our beloved Singapore.</strong></h2>
<p>
<br>Singaporeʼs birthday is coming soon, and we cannot be prouder of how majestic
our lion city has become. Letʼs celebrate our nation’s birthday by showing
our friends, family and fellow Singaporeans how weʼve contributed to nation
building and what keeps us inspired to continue building Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>The campaign period starts from 1<sup>st</sup> August to 9<sup>th</sup> August</em></strong><em>,</em> in
conjunction with National Day. <strong><em>We invite all PEs to post on their Instagram, Facebook and/or LinkedIn and celebrate as a BE community.</em></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Via our ‘9-5-9ʼ social media celebration, we get to showcase what we do
during work hours from 9-5, and after work hours from 5-9.</p>
